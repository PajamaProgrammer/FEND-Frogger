#### Aditional Information

This is the third project in Udacity's [Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001) program. The goal was to create a clone of the classic arcade game Frogger. A set of art graphics and simple game engine were provided. Additional features were encouraged once the basic game requirements were met. Because my mother is a teacher, I added mathmatical challenges for her students to practice :)
